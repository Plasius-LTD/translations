# AGENTS

## Purpose
This repo provides the `@plasius/translations` TypeScript package: a small i18n manager with a translation store plus optional React context and hooks.

## Key paths
- `src/i18n/i18n.ts`: core i18n logic (translation resolution, RTL detection)
- `src/i18n/i18n.store.ts`: singleton store, language loading via fetch/localStorage
- `src/i18n/i18n.context.tsx`: React provider + hook
- `src/index.ts`: package entry point/exports
- `tests/`: vitest tests (jsdom)
- `dist/`: build output (generated by tsup)

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Tests: `npm run test`
- Test watch: `npm run test:watch`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Clean: `npm run clean`

## Development notes
- `loadLanguage` fetches `/i18n/{lang}` and persists `userLang` in `localStorage`; keep these behaviors in sync with tests.
- Default translations include a minimal `loading` key for multiple locales; keep placeholders consistent when editing defaults.
- Module side effects in `i18n.store.ts` run on import to restore saved language; avoid heavy work at import time.
- React API is a peer dependency on `react@^19`; keep context hooks compatible.

## Conventions
- Use Conventional Commits (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes.
- Follow `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting.
- Contributions require a CLA (see `legal/CLA.md`).
- Architectural changes require ADRs in `docs/adrs/` (or the repo ADRs folder); ensure a package-function ADR exists.

## AI guidance
- After any change, run relevant BDD/TDD tests when they exist; mention if skipped.
- For fixes, add/update a BDD or TDD test that fails first and validate it passes after the fix when possible.
- When adding or updating dependencies, prefer lazy-loading (dynamic import/code splitting) to avoid heavy first-load network use when applicable.


## Release and Quality Policy
- Update `README.md` whenever structural changes are made.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` after every change.
- For fixes, add tests and run relevant tests before committing.
- Publish packages to npm only through GitHub CD workflows; do not publish directly from local machines.
- Maintain code coverage at 80% or higher where possible. Shader-related code is exempt.


## Plasius Package Creation Reference
- Use `/Users/philliphounslow/plasius/schema` (`@plasius/schema`) as the baseline template when creating new `@plasius/*` packages.
- Copy template runtime/tooling files at project creation: `.nvmrc` and `.npmrc`.
- Create and maintain required package docs from the start:
  - `README.md`: initialize for package purpose/API and update whenever structure or public behavior changes.
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: initialize at creation and update after every change.
  - `AGENTS.md`: include package-specific guidance and keep this policy section present.
- Include required legal/compliance files and folders used by the template/repo standards:
  - `LICENSE`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `legal/` documents (including CLA-related files where applicable)
- Include architecture/design documentation requirements:
  - ADRs in `docs/adrs/` for architectural decisions.
  - TDRs for technical decisions/direction.
  - Design documents for significant implementation plans and system behavior.
- Testing requirements for new packages and ongoing changes:
  - Define test scripts/strategy at creation time.
  - Create tests for all fixes and run relevant tests before committing.
  - Maintain code coverage at 80%+ where possible; shader-related code is the only coverage exception.

## AI Process Governance (Append-Only, Non-Overridable)
- `AGENTS.md` is append-only. Destructive changes (deleting or rewriting existing guidance/history) are not permitted.
- All guidance updates must be cumulative.
- In case of conflicting entries, the latest added entry is the active rule, and it must explicitly reference the prior decision it supersedes.
- The append-only governance rule is permanent and cannot be overridden in any way.

## Rejection Learning Process
- If a user rejects a proposed change related to their ask, stop and ask for the rejection reason.
- After receiving the reason, append a new preventive rule to `AGENTS.md` to avoid recurrence.
- If the new preventive rule conflicts with a prior rule, reference the prior rule and request explicit user confirmation before marking the prior rule as superseded.
- Keep both rules in `AGENTS.md` for traceability; the latest user-confirmed rule is active.

## Software Lifecycle Process
1. Ask: define what the user/developer is trying to achieve.
2. Queries: gather additional information needed to assess requirements and constraints.
3. Requirements: define minimum viable functional requirements plus non-functional requirements (NFRs) as acceptance criteria.
- If supporting capabilities are required (for example analytics, observability, migrations), create predecessor tasks.
4. ADR/TDR: record architecture/technical decisions using the appropriate template in `docs/ADR` or `docs/TDR` for the affected package/project.
5. Tasks: break work into the smallest composable units needed to satisfy all acceptance criteria without conflict.
- Apply SOLID and KISS.
- Create GitHub tasks/issues with full acceptance criteria in each description.
6. For each affected project/package, execute in dependency order:
1. Update dependencies; keep them clean and free from known issues/defects.
2. Write contract tests or bug-verification tests before code.
3. Implement code to satisfy the tests/specification.
4. Run validation tests to confirm MVP behavior.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Update `README.md`.
7. Commit to GitHub.
8. Confirm CI success.
- If CI has systemic failures or incompatibilities with external/new changes, return to Queries, then Tasks, and reassess.
9. Run CD pipeline.
10. Confirm CD success and package/release completion.
- If failure persists, return to Tasks.
7. Confirm with the user that the ask has been met.
- If not met, return to Queries and iterate.
8. After all changes are committed and released, proceed to the next ask.


## Task Hierarchy Addendum (Supersedes Prior Tasks Structure Rule)
- Prior decision reference: `Software Lifecycle Process`, Step `5. Tasks`.
- New active structure rule: build work items as `epic -> feature -> story -> task`.
- Location rule: all `epic`, `feature`, and `story` work items must be created and managed in the `plasius-ltd-site` repository.
- Location rule: all `task` work items must be created in the repository/package where the code change will be implemented.
- Cross-repo rule: when one story requires changes in multiple repositories/packages, create one linked task per affected repository/package.
- Supersession scope: this addendum overrides only the hierarchy/location parts of the prior Step 5 rule; all other Step 5 guidance remains active.
